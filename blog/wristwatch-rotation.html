    <h2>my wristwatch rotation</h2>

    <p class="blog">I'm not really a watch guy. I don't have a grail watch or anythingâ€”I have these two simply because they were gifts. Still, they're my favorite thing to put on every day.</p>
    <p class="blog">Until recently, my daily was an Apple Watch Series 7, also a gift that I've worn since 2021. Over time, I started to question whether I actually benefit from the utility of having a computer strapped to my body. The Apple Watch is just your iPhone that's constantly in your face. I started to get aggravated from every single notifcation and text that would tap me on the wrist. Now, I only take out the Apple Watch to track workouts and to wake me up in the morning. Plus, it's pretty ugly.</p>
    <p class="blog">Now that I've fixed up these two, my outfits feel complete. Who knew wearing cool watches is like aurafarming.</p>
    <p class="blog">Respect to smartwatches though, they save lives.</p>

    <h4>Casio Oceanus OCW-T100</h4>
    <img src="../assets/photos/casio.jpg">
    <p class="blog">My grandfather gifted me this watch circa 2015, I think from some Bic Camera in Tokyo. I wore it through most of middle and high school. It's a solar watch with atomic timekeeping, which confused me when I was younger so I would haphazardly mash the four buttons until it would sync.</p>
    <p class="blog">I recently charged this guy back up but had trouble establishing connection with WWVB in Fort Collins. It was probably user error, but it would time out every time I tried. I read online that others had luck syncing their radio watches with apps. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jntc.clockwavesync&hl=en-US" target="_blank">"radio watch sync"</a> worked like a charm, and I recommend the Android version because you can activate "beast mode" with ads, instead of a paid upgrade like on iOS. Also, do the syncing when no one is around because I think you want the volume to be loud and I upset my girlfriend doing this.</p>
    <p class="blog">Maybe because the watch wasn't charged for a long time, but the date is behind by three days, no matter how many times I tried to re-sync. It doesn't bother me though.</p>
    <p class="blog">I really appreciate that this watch is ultra time-accurate, and I never have to worry about accidentally turning the crown. It's been my go-to for casually heading out.</p>

    <h4>Seiko Chronograph 6T63-00D0</h4>
    <img src="../assets/photos/seiko.jpg">
    <p class="blog">Gifted to me by my dad on my 18th birthday. What you would expect to be a blue second hand is actually for the stopwatch. It uses quartz timing (whatever that means) and when you reset the stopwatch you can't even see the hand moveâ€”it's an instant reset.</p>
    <p class="blog">I had stopped wearing this a few years ago because the battery died. I took it to <a href="https://maps.apple.com/place?place-id=I1182784450FA0925&address=6143+FM+1960+Rd+W,+Houston,+TX++77069,+United+States&coordinate=29.9741817,-95.5216545&name=Watch+Hospital&_provider=9902" target="_blank">Watch Hospital</a> in Houston, and they had it ready in 15 minutes.</p>
    <p class="blog">I think this watch has such a professional feel. I've worn this to many job interviews, and I've been wearing it frequently to work.</p>
